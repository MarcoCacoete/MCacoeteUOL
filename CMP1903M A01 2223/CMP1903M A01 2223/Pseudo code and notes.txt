Once again my file with my pseudo code and notes got lost while trying to troubleshoot problems with Visual Studio and Github.


To do:
	- Figure out if I can keep the methods static and use gets to be able to supply the referenced objects or variables.
	- Work out how to do the riffle shuffle.
	- Get the testing class to work in a smooth way and not be forced to do all the steps before wanting to test individual parts of the code.
	- Also need to polish all methods because they are barebones, need to put in place error handling for wrong inputs or for the program not accounting for something.


	Email lecturer if I don't get an answer about the email I sent.
